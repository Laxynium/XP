1. Default formating option is the one coming from Intellij IDE.

2. Each method in method chain should be in next line.

3. We should follow the standard Java naming convention, bracing and folding.
This means, we are following naming convension:
 -camelCase for variable names, method names
 -PascalCase for class names
 -names of the file are same as class name

Following brackets layout:
 -opening bracket is in the same line as method or class declaration
 -closing bracket is in the new line after given scope.

4. Code variable, methods, comments, etc. are in english language.

5. We are using 4 spaces for code indentation.

6. Each class is in separate file
